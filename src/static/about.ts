                "text": "Unbiased AI for Poetry Analysis is a multi-year research initiative led by Dr. Kahyun Choi that aims to improve how poetry is discovered, understood, and curated in large-scale digital libraries. While the digitization of literary materials has made collections more accessible than ever, most library systems still rely on basic metadata—such as author names or titles—which limits meaningful exploration. This challenge is especially acute for poetry, a genre that often uses metaphor, abstraction, and emotional nuance that evade traditional classification tools. Without descriptive tags like “grief,” “love,” or “resistance,” many poems—particularly those by historically underrepresented authors—remain invisible in catalog searches. To bridge this gap, the project is building AI models capable of extracting high-level metadata such as theme and emotion, thereby enabling more content-driven search, discovery, and curation.",

                "text": "Poetry’s complexity makes it a particularly difficult genre for artificial intelligence. Most state-of-the-art language models, including those built on large foundation architectures like BERT or GPT-3, perform well on common text types such as news articles or product reviews. However, they falter when applied to poetry, which often involves layered meanings, figurative language, and emotionally charged phrasing that even human readers interpret in varied ways. To address this, the project is designing a new model development pipeline that centers ethical and equitable AI practices. This includes careful data collection across diverse poetic traditions, a rigorous annotation process led by student readers from varied backgrounds, and the use of auxiliary information—such as poet biographies, author’s notes, and critical commentary—to guide machine learning models. By involving domain experts, librarians, and readers throughout the AI lifecycle, the team aims to ensure that the resulting tools do not replicate or amplify existing social biases but instead offer new pathways for equity and discovery in the literary record.",

Over three years, the team will develop an open-source toolkit that includes annotation software, pre-trained models for theme and emotion classification, a public-facing discovery website, and integration with the HTRC’s existing analytics platform. These resources will empower librarians to curate poetry collections with greater intentionality and inclusivity, while also supporting patrons and researchers seeking deeper engagement with poetic texts.
